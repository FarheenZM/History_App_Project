# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way. 

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some user interactivity, e.g. to move through different sections of content 

Some samples of existing apps for inspiration:

- http://chemistryset.chemheritage.org/#/
- http://www.royalmailheritage.com/main.php
- http://education.iceandsky.com/
- http://histography.io - may only work in Safari
- http://worldpopulationhistory.org/map/1838/mercator/1/0/24/

Your project must meet the following specification:

- It must be a full stack React app.
- It can contain anything that you have learnt in the past 4 weeks - Maps, Graphs etc.


Before you start this project, write an MVP and potential extensions. You **must** get this signed off by an instructor before proceeding.
